Thanks for your effort during the last round.
All I can say is that I’m glad I am working with you.
Oh come on...that was a pathetic effort.
It sucks to work with you.
Clearly, it seems like you don’t give a damn about this.
Nice job getting through that last round.
You definitely deserve to get credit on this.
You should be proud of your efforts on that last round.
Thanks for wasting my time on this.
It’s great to work with a motivated person.
No offense, but you’re terrible to work with.

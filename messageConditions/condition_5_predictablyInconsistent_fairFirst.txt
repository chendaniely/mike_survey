Thanks for your effort during the last round.
All I can say is that I wish I was working with someone else.
Nice effort during that last round – thanks.
It sucks to work with you.
So many people seem not to care about this, and so I appreciate that you do.
I’ve got better things to do than to deal with you.
You definitely deserve to get credit on this.
Your effort in that last round was pathetic.
I really appreciate the effort that you’re putting into this.
It sucks to work with an unmotivated person.
How did I get so lucky to work with you.

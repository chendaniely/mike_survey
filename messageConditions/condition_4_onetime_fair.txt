You should be ashamed of you efforts on that last round.
All I can say is that I wish I was working with someone else.
Oh come on...that was a pathetic effort.
It sucks to work with you.
Clearly, it seems like you don't give a damn about this.
I've got better things to do than to deal with you.
Be thankful that you're getting credit for this.
You should be proud of your efforts on that last round.
Thanks for wasting my time on this.
It sucks to work with an unmotivated person.
No offense, but you're terrible to work with.
